# Audio File General Format

## Full Song Files

All full song audio files must follow the naming convention below:

    "Character Index Number"_"Song Index Number".mp3

For example, this is the first character's fifth song in the sequence:

    0_4.mp3

## Dynamic Song Files

All dynamic song audio files must follow the naming convention below:

    "Character Index Number"_"Song Index Number"-"Song Audio Level"-"Optional Song Part".mp3

This version adds a dash with this particular file's track level on it and an optional second dash with the song's part. So the baseline track of the first character's fifth song would look like this:

    0_4-0.mp3

And if that song had multiple parts, the second level track of the second part of that song would look like this:

    0_4-1-1.mp3

The song parts are *almost exclusively* used for songs that need to be split up into seperate files for sake of the BPM.

## Formatting Tips

* Double check and triple check that the uploaded song is following the correct naming convention.
* Make sure the file starts immediately otherwise the song will not work correctly in the game.
* Make sure that the file is uploaded in the correct folder otherwise it wont be found correctly.
* After uploading the file in the correct folder for audio, update the table below with it's information.
